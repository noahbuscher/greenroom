# Greenroom :maple_leaf:

Greenroom is a cannabis dispensary database that can ingest CSV or individual entries.
It's designed with Flowhub's needs in mind, potentially helping sales teams discover
untapped clients. You can explore entires in a stream and filter by state, city, and
pipeline status to help find the leads you're looking for, faster.

## Development

Getting started with Greenroom is easy. Just run this command in the root directory to spin up a local instance.

_Note: Make sure you have a MongoDB instance running._

```
yarn install && cd server/client && yarn install && cd ../../ && yarn start
```
